# Securing Pharmaceutical Data using Homomorphic Encryption

This project demonstrates the use of homomorphic encryption
to securely process pharmaceutical data without decrypting it.

Paillier encryption is used to perform computations on encrypted
data while preserving confidentiality.

This repository represents a simplified and functional
implementation of an academic major project.
